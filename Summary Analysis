## Research: NordVPN Encryption and Privacy Features
 - Encryption: Uses AES-256 encryption for OpenVPN and ChaCha20 with NordLynx. This is the industry standard for robust security.
 - Protocols: Supports NordLynx (WireGuard-based, fast and secure), OpenVPN (very secure), NordWhisper (for obfuscation), and IKEv2.
 - Privacy Features: Located in Panama (strong privacy jurisdiction), strict no-logs policy, RAM-only servers (no persistent data), kill switch, double VPN, Onion over VPN, obfuscated servers for anti-censorship.
 - Advanced: Post-quantum encryption available on most apps as of 2025; Threat Protection blocks ads, trackers, and malware.

## Summary:
Free VPNs like ProtonVPN and Windscribe offer a solid introduction to VPN security with strong encryption and privacy, 
but are limited in speed, server choice, and advanced features. NordVPN (paid) delivers faster speeds, wider server access, 
more advanced privacy/safety features, and superior streaming and customer supportâ€”making it better suited for regular, security-conscious, or power users.
