## Setup & Hands-On Steps
1. **Downloaded & installed** NordVPN app from [nordvpn.com](https://nordvpn.com).
2. **Logged in** using my paid account.
3. **Connected** to the fastest server via Quick Connect, and also tested manual location selection.
4. **Verified IP change:** Used [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before and after connection.
5. **Tested encryption:** Used [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net) to confirm there were no IP/DNS leaks and that web traffic was protected.
6. **Disconnected and checked:** Confirmed my real IP address returned and compared browsing speed (minimal change with NordVPN).
7. **Researched NordVPN’s encryption & privacy:** AES-256, ChaCha20, RAM-only servers, double VPN, Onion over VPN, Threat Protection.
8. **Documented** benefits and limitations specific to NordVPN.
